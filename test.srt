1
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,896
<i>Just 50 years ago,</i>

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,400
<i>we finally ventured to the moon.</i>

3
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:44,878
<i>For the very first time,
we look back at our own planet.</i>

4
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:57,766
<i>Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.</i>

5
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,817
<i>This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain,</i>

6
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,362
<i>and reveal what we must preserve</i>

7
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,992
<i>to ensure people and nature thrive.</i>

8
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,264
<i>When human beings
built their first settlements</i>

9
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,475
<i>some 10,000 years ago,</i>

10
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,519
<i>the world around them,</i>

11
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,522
<i>on the land and in the sea,</i>

12
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,148
<i>was full of life.</i>

13
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:11,339
<i>For generations, this stable Eden
nurtured our growing civilizations.</i>

14
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,265
<i>But now, in the space
of just one human lifetime,</i>

15
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,767
<i>all that has changed.</i>

16
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,939
<i>In the last 50 years,</i>

17
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,944
<i>wildlife populations have, on average,
declined by 60 percent.</i>

18
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,658
<i>For the first time in human history,</i>

19
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:43,496
<i>the stability of nature
can no longer be taken for granted.</i>

20
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,969
<i>But the natural world is resilient.</i>

21
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,598
<i>Great riches still remain.</i>

22
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,983
<i>And with our help, the planet can recover.</i>

23
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:21,993
<i>Never has it been more important
to understand how the natural world works,</i>

24
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,078
<i>and how to help it.</i>

25
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,230
<i>Wildlife still flourishes
in astonishing numbers</i>

26
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,107
<i>in a few precious places.</i>

27
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,908
<i>Along the Peruvian coast of South America,</i>

28
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:07,038
<i>seabirds congregate
in colonies millions strong.</i>

29
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,503
<i>They come here to breed.</i>

30
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,808
<i>Every morning,
the birds leave their colonies</i>

31
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,062
<i>to fish in one of the richest seas
on Earth.</i>

32
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,200
<i>It is an astonishing daily migration</i>

33
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,287
<i>of five million birds.</i>

34
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:58,131
<i>The huge flocks of cormorants and boobies
are all seeking one thing:</i>

35
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,634
<i>anchovies.</i>

36
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,943
<i>The boobies carpet-bomb the shoals.</i>

37
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:31,539
<i>More and more birds
join the feeding frenzy.</i>

38
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,750
<i>All in this immense assembly are here</i>

39
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,962
<i>because a powerful oceanic current,
the Humboldt,</i>

40
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,090
<i>sweeps up from the Antarctic,</i>

41
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,761
<i>bringing with it rich nutrients
from the ocean's depths.</i>

42
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,311
<i>90 percent of the life in the oceans</i>

43
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,731
<i>is found in the shallow seas
close to the coast.</i>

44
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,821
<i>Away from the land,</i>

45
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,908
<i>the seas, for the most part,
are a blue desert.</i>

46
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,830
<i>But even these distant waters
may be enriched</i>

47
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,667
<i>by a most unexpected connection
to the land.</i>

48
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,424
<i>Some deserts,</i>

49
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,135
<i>often hundreds of kilometers
from the ocean,</i>

50
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,264
<i>provide the raw materials for life.</i>

51
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:28,573
<i>Every year, winds sweep up
two billion tons of dust into the sky.</i>

52
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,580
<i>At least a quarter of it
eventually falls on the sea,</i>

53
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:40,751
<i>providing nutrients
needed by the microscopic organisms</i>

54
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:44,422
<i>that are the foundations of ocean life.</i>

55
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,019
<i>Dolphins explore the vast, open ocean</i>

56
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:03,065
<i>in search of the riches
that distant deserts may have nourished.</i>

57
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:16,579
<i>A shoal of mackerel
has discovered a swarm of krill...</i>

58
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,124
<i>the small crustaceans</i>

59
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,544
<i>that feed on the ocean's
floating microscopic plants.</i>

60
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,966
<i>But the mackerel themselves
are food for the dolphins.</i>

61
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,152
<i>They drive the mackerel
towards the surface,</i>

62
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,197
<i>and into the range of birds.</i>

63
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,034
<i>Shearwaters.</i>

64
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,747
<i>The wings that normally propel the birds
through the air</i>

65
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,209
<i>now drive them six meters down
through the water.</i>

66
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,219
<i>Whilst the birds
pick off the top of the shoal...</i>

67
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,684
<i>the dolphins attack the underside.</i>

68
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,263
<i>After 20 minutes of feasting,</i>

69
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,975
<i>the predators
from both the sea and the air</i>

70
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,269
<i>have had their fill.</i>

71
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,831
<i>The stability of life on our planet</i>

72
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:28,419
<i>relies on such connections
between different habitats.</i>

73
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,717
<i>Water evaporating
from the surface of the sea</i>

74
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,137
<i>condenses to form great clouds.</i>

75
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:46,687
<i>And these eventually
release the fresh water as rain.</i>

76
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:56,530
<i>But these life-giving rains
are not evenly spread over the land.</i>

77
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,749
<i>This vast salt pan in Africa</i>

78
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,503
<i>is all that remains of an ancient lake.</i>

79
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,551
<i>It's totally waterless and oven-hot.</i>

80
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:22,264
<i>Few places on the land
are more hostile to life.</i>

81
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:35,277
<i>A few tracks cross it, made by animals
searching unsuccessfully for water.</i>

82
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:01,595
<i>But very occasionally,
this whole landscape is transformed.</i>

83
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:24,326
<i>A huge deluge drenches the salt pan.</i>

84
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,845
<i>Triggered by some unknown signal,</i>

85
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,726
<i>flocks of lesser flamingos
arrive from thousands of kilometers away.</i>

86
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,239
<i>The algae that the flamingos feed on</i>

87
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,868
<i>have lain dormant as spores in the dust.</i>

88
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,500
<i>But most importantly,</i>

89
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,503
<i>the birds are here to breed.</i>

90
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:22,760
<i>Perfect conditions might occur
only once in a decade.</i>

91
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,102
<i>The birds nest on an island
far from the shore.</i>

92
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,025
<i>They build mounds of mud
that raise up their eggs</i>

93
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:43,030
<i>and so keep them just marginally cooler
than they would be at ground level.</i>

94
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,204
<i>The water surrounding the island
is so salty</i>

95
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,790
<i>that predators do not venture into it.</i>

96
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,835
<i>So the nests are safe.</i>

97
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:05,177
<i>Thirty days later,
thousands of chicks start to hatch.</i>

98
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,570
<i>But there is no shelter
from the scorching sun.</i>

99
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:29,159
<i>The water that once surrounded
their island, protecting them,</i>

100
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,245
<i>has now dried up altogether.</i>

101
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:43,799
<i>The last to hatch
step out into a desperately harsh world.</i>

102
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:02,568
<i>Somehow or other, the growing chicks
must find fresh water to drink.</i>

103
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:12,411
<i>They cannot yet fly, so they must walk,
guided by some of the adults.</i>

104
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,012
<i>They may have to trek for 50 kilometers.</i>

105
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,963
<i>Some... cannot keep up.</i>

106
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,888
<i>The salt has solidified around their legs.</i>

107
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,094
<i>Most of the chicks,
in spite of everything,</i>

108
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,263
<i>and having walked for days,</i>

109
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,724
<i>eventually reach fresh water.</i>

110
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,538
<i>It is the end of a long journey...</i>

111
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:26,295
<i>but only the first of the trials
that will be imposed on these flamingos</i>

112
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,048
<i>by the irregularity of the rains.</i>

113
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,436
<i>If rainfall is more predictable
and certain,</i>

114
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,189
<i>then life can flourish more richly,</i>

115
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,568
<i>both in numbers and variety.</i>

116
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:59,453
<i>The Serengeti plains in East Africa
support over a million wildebeest.</i>

117
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,292
<i>The herds follow the seasonal rains,</i>

118
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,421
<i>grazing on the newly-sprouting grass
that comes in their wake.</i>

119
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,726
<i>Each year, within a three-week period,</i>

120
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:27,773
<i>the females give birth
to over a quarter of a million calves.</i>

121
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,743
<i>This youngster is just a few days old.</i>

122
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:45,124
<i>Playing strengthens its legs
for the long journey that lies ahead.</i>

123
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,283
<i>The calf must stay close to its mother.</i>

124
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,202
<i>Without her milk, it would starve.</i>

125
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,959
<i>And the herds are always traveling,</i>

126
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,172
<i>following the rains
as they drift across the plains</i>

127
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,799
<i>in order to find fresh grazing.</i>

128
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,265
<i>Eventually, they reach woodlands.</i>

129
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,660
<i>Hunting dogs.</i>

130
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,168
<i>Wildebeest calves are a favorite prey.</i>

131
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,382
<i>And the dogs are hungry.</i>

132
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,485
<i>The calf must stay with its mother,
protected within the herd.</i>

133
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,030
<i>The dogs have incredible stamina...</i>

134
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,704
<i>but the calf is defended by the herd.</i>

135
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,631
<i>They need the calf on its own.</i>

136
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,987
<i>The mother blocks the dogs,
shielding her calf.</i>

137
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,621
<i>It makes a run for safety.</i>

138
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,761
<i>And it just manages
to get back to the herd.</i>

139
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:58,418
<i>The future of this whole migration
depends on the regularity of the rains,</i>

140
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:04,132
<i>but also on the continued existence
of the great open grasslands</i>

141
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,844
<i>across which the herds
make their immense journeys.</i>

142
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:21,608
<i>In places where rains fall abundantly
throughout the year, forests grow,</i>

143
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,070
<i>and in the warmth of the tropics,</i>

144
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,573
<i>they support
an unparalleled richness of life.</i>

145
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:35,205
<i>Half of all the species
of land-living animals</i>

146
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,666
<i>live in these stable worlds.</i>

147
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,714
<i>The sheer diversity is breathtaking.</i>

148
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,639
<i>We still have not catalogued</i>

149
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:56,143
<i>all the species that live
in the tropical forests.</i>

150
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:16,621
<i>The relationships between them all
are multitudinous and complex.</i>

151
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:26,339
<i>Plants often depend on animals
to pollinate their flowers.</i>

152
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,928
<i>And these intimate connections</i>

153
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,682
<i>are just as important
as the great global ones.</i>

154
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,277
<i>These are traps.</i>

155
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,739
<i>Flowers shaped like buckets,</i>

156
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,782
<i>produced by an orchid.</i>

157
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:07,255
<i>Each red bucket is filled
with an oily liquid that drips from above.</i>

158
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:18,850
<i>Male orchid bees need a rich perfume
with which to impress their females,</i>

159
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,562
<i>and the orchids provide it.</i>

160
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,985
<i>But the bucket is slippery,</i>

161
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:35,534
<i>and the liquid
into which the bee has fallen is sticky.</i>

162
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,997
<i>The only way to get out</i>

163
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,167
<i>is through a narrow tunnel.</i>

164
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,007
<i>As it emerges, the bee is gripped tight.</i>

165
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,179
<i>And that gives enough time for the plant</i>

166
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,183
<i>to glue pollen sacs on the bee's back.</i>

167
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:08,149
<i>So the orchid has its pollen
taken to another plant...</i>

168
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,154
<i>and the bee is rewarded with a perfume,</i>

169
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,116
<i>with which, when it recovers its strength,</i>

170
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,201
<i>it can woo a female.</i>

171
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,170
<i>There are no pronounced seasons
in a rainforest.</i>

172
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:37,012
<i>It produces food in one form or another
the year round.</i>

173
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,352
<i>It's so rich
that the females of some birds</i>

174
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,856
<i>are able to raise their young
entirely by themselves,</i>

175
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:52,777
<i>and that allows the males to spend
their whole time attracting females...</i>

176
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,822
<i>...as manakins do.</i>

177
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,452
<i>There are over 50 different species,</i>

178
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,955
<i>each with its own
highly elaborate dance routine.</i>

179
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,381
<i>The golden-collared manakin</i>

180
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,259
<i>starts by clearing his dance floor.</i>

181
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:28,188
<i>A female arrives
and he starts his routine,</i>

182
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,565
<i>rocketing from one perch to another.</i>

183
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,073
<i>She checks out every detail.</i>

184
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,877
<i>Finally, he performs his signature move.</i>

185
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,297
<i>The back-flip...</i>

186
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,511
<i>...with twist.</i>

187
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,057
<i>Perfection.</i>

188
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:13,024
<i>The red-capped manakin
has a very different act.</i>

189
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,697
<i>It's a kind of slither.</i>

190
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,625
<i>With wing snaps.</i>

191
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,682
<i>But it doesn't seem to be working.</i>

192
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,325
<i>She's seen enough.</i>

193
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:13,668
<i>The most complex routine
is that developed by the blue manakin.</i>

194
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,966
<i>The lead male
is supported by three junior dancers.</i>

195
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,305
<i>They practice together almost every day.</i>

196
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,517
<i>During rehearsals,</i>

197
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,646
<i>a young male in juvenile plumage
stands in for the female.</i>

198
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,696
<i>The dance
has to be perfectly synchronized.</i>

199
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,871
<i>With the lead male happy...</i>

200
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,419
<i>they're ready to present their dance
to a female.</i>

201
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:13,520
<i>In a carousel of movements,
each male takes his turn at the front.</i>

202
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,794
<i>The lead male performs the final move.</i>

203
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,508
<i>Have they done enough?</i>

204
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,719
<i>What's her decision?</i>

205
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,351
<i>It's...</i>

206
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,812
<i>a yes!</i>

207
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,985
<i>A great team effort.</i>

208
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:12,495
<i>Tropical forests cover
only seven percent of the planet's lands.</i>

209
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:18,084
<i>Away from the tropics,
where the weather is seasonal and cooler,</i>

210
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,752
<i>they're very different.</i>

211
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,968
<i>The greatest of all is the boreal forest</i>

212
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:31,347
<i>that extends right across North America
and Eurasia.</i>

213
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,983
<i>It cannot grow
during the frigid grip of winter.</i>

214
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,948
<i>The forests are a crucial refuge</i>

215
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,786
<i>for the relatively few species
that are able to survive here.</i>

216
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,672
<i>As winter approaches,</i>

217
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,593
<i>caribou grazing on the open tundra
to the north</i>

218
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:13,431
<i>head south to the forest
to seek food and shelter.</i>

219
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:29,906
<i>Out here, temperatures may fall
below minus 40 degrees centigrade.</i>

220
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:42,835
<i>The forest will give some protection
from the worst of the weather.</i>

221
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:13,241
<i>But now the caribou
are not traveling alone.</i>

222
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,834
<i>Wolves.</i>

223
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,255
<i>They live in the forest year-round.</i>

224
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,597
<i>And in the winter,
they specialize in hunting caribou.</i>

225
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,906
<i>They must find the freshest tracks.</i>

226
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,880
<i>They move fast by avoiding the deep snow,</i>

227
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,134
<i>sticking to the hard-packed trails
made by the caribou.</i>

228
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,142
<i>This wolf has found fresh scent.</i>

229
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,321
<i>The caribou must be close.</i>

230
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:48,419
<i>The herd chooses to stop to rest
on a frozen lake.</i>

231
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,217
<i>Out in the open, they will be able to spot
approaching danger.</i>

232
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,265
<i>And sure enough, the wolves catch up.</i>

233
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,949
<i>They start to test the caribou,</i>

234
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,576
<i>probing for any weakness.</i>

235
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,091
<i>Out on the open lake,</i>

236
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,594
<i>the caribou can outrun the wolves...</i>

237
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,354
<i>so the wolves drive them back
into the forest.</i>

238
00:35:56,571 --> 00:36:01,534
<i>Here, in the deep snow,
progress is much harder and slower.</i>

239
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:14,881
<i>And, hidden by the trees,
the wolves can get closer.</i>

240
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,346
<i>The hunt is on.</i>

241
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,988
<i>The pack must decide
which particular caribou to target</i>

242
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,408
<i>and which trail to take.</i>

243
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,250
<i>As the caribou scatter,</i>

244
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,214
<i>the leading wolf takes a wrong turn.</i>

245
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:04,764
<i>It's a crucial mistake,
and the wolves abandon the chase.</i>

246
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:18,402
<i>With the coming of spring,
the caribou will head north once more,</i>

247
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,614
<i>leaving the wolves and the forest behind.</i>

248
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:29,747
<i>They will travel 600 kilometers,
crossing mountains to reach the tundra,</i>

249
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,875
<i>where the spring grass
will be sprouting again,</i>

250
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,835
<i>and they can give birth.</i>

251
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,218
<i>But these migrations
are a shadow of what they once were.</i>

252
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:48,307
<i>The herd has lost
nearly 70 percent of its numbers</i>

253
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,268
<i>in the last 20 years.</i>

254
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:58,150
<i>Their world and all of our planet
is now changing fast.</i>

255
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,660
<i>At the furthest polar extremes</i>

256
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:13,541
<i>lie the frozen wildernesses
of Antarctica and the Arctic.</i>

257
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:21,173
<i>Though they may seem remote
to many of us,</i>

258
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:27,388
<i>the stability of these icy wastes
is crucial to all life on the planet.</i>

259
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:39,025
<i>But in just 70 years,
things have changed at a frightening pace.</i>

260
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:46,449
<i>The polar regions are warming faster
than any other part of the planet.</i>

261
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:57,710
<i>The Arctic in the north is a frozen ocean,</i>

262
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,466
<i>and the sea ice,
on which all life here depends,</i>

263
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,634
<i>is disappearing.</i>

264
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,777
<i>Polar bears</i>

265
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,406
<i>specialize in hunting seals
out on the frozen ocean.</i>

266
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,042
<i>But that world is now, literally,
melting beneath their feet.</i>

267
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,799
<i>The sea ice breaks up every year,</i>

268
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,385
<i>but now this is happening earlier,</i>

269
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,347
<i>and the bears' limited hunting season
is getting shorter.</i>

270
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:57,103
<i>This is already having a profound impact.</i>

271
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,951
<i>Cubs are growing up underweight,</i>

272
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,580
<i>which reduces their chances of survival.</i>

273
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,643
<i>Within the lifetime of these cubs,</i>

274
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:42,731
<i>the Arctic in summer
could be largely free of sea ice.</i>

275
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,251
<i>It's not just the sea ice
that is vanishing.</i>

276
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:08,174
<i>The ice that lies on land
is also changing fast.</i>

277
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,847
<i>This is Greenland,</i>

278
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:20,853
<i>a vast expanse of ice
one-fifth the size of the United States.</i>

279
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:31,614
<i>This glacial ice,
together with the sea ice,</i>

280
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:37,077
<i>protects our planet by reflecting
solar radiation away from the surface</i>

281
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,289
<i>and so preventing the Earth
from overheating.</i>

282
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,881
<i>But the Arctic is warming dramatically.</i>

283
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:00,893
<i>The leading edge of the Store Glacier
may appear to be motionless,</i>

284
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:06,106
<i>but glaciers can move
at up to 45 meters a day.</i>

285
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:18,035
<i>Where this one meets the sea,
it towers 100 meters above the water,</i>

286
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,831
<i>and continues downward
for another 400 meters</i>

287
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,333
<i>beneath the surface.</i>

288
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:12,840
<i>Over the last 20 years,
Greenland has been losing ice.</i>

289
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,766
<i>And the rate of loss is accelerating.</i>

290
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,452
<i>These massive icefalls
from the top of the glacier</i>

291
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,370
<i>are just the beginnings</i>

292
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,789
<i>of a far greater event.</i>

293
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:55,215
<i>A stretch of the front face of the glacier
over a kilometer long</i>

294
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,343
<i>is starting to break away.</i>

295
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,190
<i>From 400 meters beneath the surface,</i>

296
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,652
<i>the hidden ice is surging upwards.</i>

297
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:36,590
<i>The breakaway of an iceberg
the size of a skyscraper</i>

298
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,678
<i>generates a colossal tidal wave.</i>

299
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:02,885
<i>Within 20 minutes,
75 million tons of ice break free.</i>

300
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,771
<i>Glaciers have always released ice
into the ocean,</i>

301
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,192
<i>but now this is happening
nearly twice as fast</i>

302
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,360
